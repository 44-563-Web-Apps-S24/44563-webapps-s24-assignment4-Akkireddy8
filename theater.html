    CHARACTERS

    STEPAN STEPANOVITCH CHUBUKOV, a landowner
    NATALYA STEPANOVNA, his daughter, twenty-five years old
    IVAN VASSILEVITCH LOMOV, a neighbour of Chubukov, a large and
    hearty, but very suspicious landowner

    The scene is laid at CHUBUKOV's country-house


    A drawing-room in CHUBUKOV'S house.

    [LOMOV enters, wearing a dress-jacket and white gloves. CHUBUKOV rises
    to meet him.]

    CHUBUKOV. My dear fellow, whom do I see! Ivan Vassilevitch! I am
    extremely glad! [Squeezes his hand] Now this is a surprise, my
    darling... How are you?

    LOMOV. Thank you. And how may you be getting on?

    CHUBUKOV. We just get along somehow, my angel, to your prayers, and
    so on. Sit down, please do.... Now, you know, you shouldn't forget all
    about your neighbours, my darling. My dear fellow, why are you so formal
    in your get-up? Evening dress, gloves, and so on. Can you be going
    anywhere, my treasure?

    LOMOV. No, I've come only to see you, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.

    CHUBUKOV. Then why are you in evening dress, my precious? As if you're
    paying a New Year's Eve visit!

    LOMOV. Well, you see, it's like this. [Takes his arm] I've come to you,
    honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, to trouble you with a request. Not once or
    twice have I already had the privilege of applying to you for help, and
    you have always, so to speak... I must ask your pardon, I am getting
    excited. I shall drink some water, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.
    [Drinks.]

    CHUBUKOV. [Aside] He's come to borrow money! Shan't give him any!
    [Aloud] What is it, my beauty?
